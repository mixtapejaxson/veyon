INSTALLING AND SETTING UP EVEYON FOR USE
========================================

Please note that all instructions in this file apply to the Linux version of
eVeyon. Users of the Windows version of eVeyon should run the installer which will
guide you through the installation. Afterwards the graphical eVeyon Configurator
helps to set up eVeyon.

For further information you can also take a look at eVeyon administrator manual:

Installing eVeyon
-----------------

Requirements:

First you should download the necessary packages depending on your
Linux distribution. If there're no packages for your distribution,
try to build eVeyon yourself. See according section in README file
for details.

If there're unfulfilled requirements, your package management system (dpkg,
RPM etc.) will complain about it.


Installing:

First you have to install the necessary packages on your computer(s).
On clients you only have to install the packages eveyon:

on DPKG-based systems:

        dpkg -i  eveyon...deb

on RPM-based systems:

	rpm -i  eveyon...rpm

Of course, if your linux distribution has available such package you can install it from repositories:

	apt install eveyon

	dnf install eveyon


Essentially, there are 3 main apps in package:

-  veyon-configurator
-  veyon-service
-  veyon-master


On the master computer you must be sure to have installed veyon-master.
On clients computers remove veyon-master if you installed it.



Setup a eVeyon client
---------------------

On clients you have to make sure that the eVeyon Service is being started when
either X is started or a user logs on. There're several methods to achieve this
(this is why it's not done automatically when installing the package):

1. Add the appropriate command ("veyon-service &") to /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc or
   add an according desktop file to /etc/xdg/autostart.
   This method isn't recommend, because ICA then runs with the user's
   privileges -> the user is able to kill ICA and get out of teacher's
   control.

2. add "veyon-service &" to /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup. On some systems, this
   doesn't take effect, so either edit /etc/kde4/kdm/Xsetup or
   /etc/X11/gdm/Xsetup

You can easily test whether all is fine by running telnet on port 11100 of the
according compter.

example:

	telnet 192.168.1.2 11100


You should see something like "RFB 003.008".
